# Interactive Creature Experiment

This installation is designed to let you experiment with the interaction of a generated creature on the screen. The technology runs on **Three.js** and **HTML**.

## Goal
Our goal is to enable you to **dance live with the creature** or explore other interactive possibilities. You can:

- Develop a **new concept** based on this setup.
- Work on **pre-defined interaction challenges** following the **WELGEEN** method, such as:
  - *"What if we could interact with everyday objects in a completely new way?"*
  - *"What we are curious about: how can object recognition be used in a playful way?"*

## Example
Check out a dancing creature in action here: [Dancing Creature Demo](https://welgeen.nl/ddance/)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or run a local server.
3. Start experimenting with interactions!

## Student Challenges
Here are five different challenges that students can work on:

1. **Sketch & Create a Dance Interaction**
   - Sketch a few scenarios on paper where a user can dance with the creature in front of the screen.
   - Implement one of the sketched interactions using JavaScript and Three.js.

2. **Design an Interactive Dance Routine**
   - Draw a storyboard of different dance moves the creature could perform.
   - Code the creature to respond to user input and change its dance moves dynamically.

3. **Enhancing Object Recognition**
   - Brainstorm and sketch how object recognition can be used to influence the creature’s movements.
   - Implement object recognition features to change the behavior of the creature based on real-world objects.

4. **Create a Live Mirror with ML Body Tracking**
   - Research a machine learning body tracking library (such as Google’s MediaPipe).
   - Implement a live mirror effect where the creature mimics the user’s movements.

5. **Exploring Sound Interaction**
   - Sketch different ways sound could influence the movement of the creature.
   - Implement an audio-reactive animation where the creature dances based on music or user claps.

## Technology
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) (for body tracking)
